# Supported Geoip providers

1. Maxmind (both GeoCountry and GeoCity database) - I am using the official API to interface with their binary database. So you should be able to either the commercial version or the free version - Download the database from http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecity or http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecountry
1. Worldip (WIPmania) - Download the database from http://www.wipmania.com/en/base/
1.  Worldip (WIPmania) API - Worldip also provides an API for your to query their database live. I have included a live API version of the data source as well. You don't have to download anything, but the catch is you have got a quota of 10,000 request per day.
1. Webnet77 - This hosting company offers their own version of geoip database as well. I am not sure where they get their data from, but you can use their database at http://software77.net/geo-ip/
1. LinuxBox UK - They have a geoip database based on whois records, you can downdload their database at http://linuxbox.co.uk/ip-address-whois-database.php
1. Free GeoIP - This is a live data source, accessed through an API, you don't have to download anything, but feel free to checkout their website http://freegeoip.appspot.com/. I am not sure where they get their data from, but it looks like Maxmind data - but needs to be confirmed.
1. IP Info DB - This is another live data source I can offer. you don't have to download anything, but feel free to checkout their website http://ipinfodb.com/ip_location_api.php. They claimed their data is from Maxmind. So if you like the Maxmind data, but don't want to keep downloading database from Maxmind website to keep up-to-date, you may want to try this data source.
